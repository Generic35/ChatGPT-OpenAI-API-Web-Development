# ChatGPT-OpenAI-API-Web-Development

A web app calling the OpenAI API

- App #1: Same as Open API Playground, submit one prompt, without knowledge of any previously submited prompts (aka with no context)

- App #2: Same as Chat GPT, include previous prompts and previous answers in the messages array to keep knowledge of previous requests (aka with context).

- App #3: A recipe website with two default recipes but also the ability to submit ingredients and get a detailed recipe, with including ingredients and steps, by providing the ingredients and an JSON example of the data structure expected as response.
